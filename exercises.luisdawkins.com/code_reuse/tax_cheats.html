          <h1>Star Wars</h1>
          <p>Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions.

The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.

Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.

And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was. I seem to have found it. General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.

You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst. It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination.</p>
